I have been reading theories of NeuralNetwork for years. But for most of my experiments, I just call NN functions from other public libraries.  
To better comprehend those algorithms, I decide to write simple NN demos my own. My code is writen in Python with builtin libraries.  
Numpy is used for weights container and it can be seamlessly replaced with a newly developed GPU-based numpy, MinPy.
